    <h1>About Page</h1>
    <p>
      I am currently a full-time student studying computer science who enjoys
      designing and building software that can give users a greater experience.
      I am learning the most I can, but mainly appreciate the front-end
      development and math aspect of computer science. Not only that, but I love
      high-paced collaborative work, appreciate minimal clean code, every code
      language out there, and testing API. Other big interests I am passionate
      about are reading, anime, music, math, and most importantly knowledge.
